# **Five Elements Game**

The Five Elements Game is an extended variation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game that many of us have played. The game has five elements (fire, earth, metal, water, wood) for the user to choose from. Each element defeats or is defeated by another element.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Although wireframes show a very basic and simple design, a different result was obtained by modeling ideas and other sources that came to mind during the project development phase.

Wireframes design fils can be find at [Wireframes](assets/wireframes) folder.

## Design

The page design has emerged as a result of a long-term research. The main design of the page was developed by modeling a challenge on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) site.

### Typography

Two fonts are preferred to have a simple design. Fonts are imported using the googlefonts API. "Poppins" is used in the body of the page and in all CTAs, "Roboto Condensed" in all titles, and the sans-serif font family is used as the fallback of both fonts.

### Colour Scheme

Body background color is a radial-gradient color consisting of the combination of colors with HEX codes #28456b and #1b1c47.
